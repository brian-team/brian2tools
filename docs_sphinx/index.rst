brian2tools documentation
=========================

The `brian2tools` package is a collection of useful tools for
the `Brian 2 simulator <https://brian2.readthedocs.org>`_. The project
is still in its infancy but it already provides helpful functions
for plotting. In the future it will be extended to also provide
analysis and export/import functions.
